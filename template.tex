\recipe[Make sure to use a large, oven-safe pan for the paella, ideally
11-$\frac{1}{2}$ inches wide. This recipe also calls for sofrito which takes an
hour by itself to make.]{Paella}{8}{V}{20 minutes}{40 minutes}

\ingredients{
    \item 3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
    \item 2 spring carrots, diced to $\frac{1}{4}$-inch
    \item 1 bunch of leeks cut into 1-inch pieces
    \item 4 or 5 small mutli-colored potatoes, chopped
    \item 3 cloves garlic, chopped
    \item 2 cups short-grain paella rice
    \item 1 cup sofrito
    \item 1-$\frac{1}{2}$ teaspoosn smoked parpika
    \item $\frac{1}{2}$ teaspoon saffron threads
    \item 5 cups hot vegetable stock
}

\instructions{
    \item Preheat oven to 300$^{\circ}$F. Healt the olive oil in the large
        skillet over medium heat. Add the carrots and garlic and let them cook
        for a few minutes.

    \item Add in the paella rice, being sure to stir well and often as to not
        let the rice burn. Cook until the rice grains become translucent and
        then stir in the sofrito. Add the smoked paprika. Crush the saffron
        between your fingers and then add it.

    \item Stir in the potatoes and leeks and pour the hot stock over all of it.
        Stir and then bring it to a moderate simmer. Simmer for exactly 17
        minutes.

    \item Move the paella to the oven (in the same pan) and bake for another 12
        minutes. After the bake has finished, if you are confident that you
        won't burn the paella, you can return the paella to the stove-top to
        create crust on the base of the paella.

    \item Top with any garnishes -- nuts, lemons, herbs -- and serve from the
        pan.
